# Changelog

All notable changes to this project will be documented in this file.

The format is based on [Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.0.0/),
and this project adheres to [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/spec/v2.0.0.html).

## [1.4.7] - 2026-02-05

### Fixed
- **CLI Argument Handling**: Improved logic to correctly identify CLI commands (like `config`, `auth`, `agent`) versus TUI commands, ensuring arguments are passed correctly.
- **Graceful Shutdown**: Fixed issue where `AbortError` (code 20) during interrupt (Ctrl+C) was logged as a fatal error. Now handles it cleanly by exiting with code 0.
- **Zombie Reaper Flag**: Fixed `--reap` flag handling to ensure it executes the reaper logic instead of passing it to opencode.

## [1.4.6] - 2026-02-05

### Fixed
- Internal release with CLI logic improvements. Superseded by 1.4.7.

## [1.4.5] - 2025-02-04

### Fixed

- **Plugin duplicate detection**: Fixed `update-plugins.ts` to properly detect local path installations (`/opentmux`) in addition to registry names, preventing duplicate plugin entries
- **Runtime duplicate prevention**: Added `isInitialized` guard in plugin entry point to prevent duplicate initialization if plugin is loaded multiple times
- **Race condition prevention**: Added `pendingSessions` Set to prevent race conditions when multiple child sessions spawn simultaneously
- **Pane layout fixes**: Fixed main-vertical-multi-column layout to correctly identify the main pane and agent panes

## [1.4.0] - 2026-02-03

### Features
* **Zombie Reaper**: Introduced a new system to automatically detect and clean up orphaned "opencode attach" processes that persist after sessions end.
  * Added `ZombieReaper` class that safely identifies zombies by verifying session status with the server.
  * Added background reaping (default interval: 30s) to `TmuxSessionManager`.
  * Added CLI command `opentmux --reap` for manual global cleanup of zombie processes.
* **Safety**: Reaper strictly validates that processes belong to the current server instance before killing them, preventing accidental termination of other active OpenCode instances.

### Fixes
* Fixed memory leak where `opencode attach` processes would remain running indefinitely after their parent tmux pane or session was closed.

## [1.3.2](https://github.com/AnganSamadder/opentmux/compare/v1.3.1...v1.3.2) (2026-02-03)


### Bug Fixes

* rename bin file to opentmux.ts ([83c3b14](https://github.com/AnganSamadder/opentmux/commit/83c3b1431fcf9304dc712940785d550a5664171e))
* restore SpawnQueue and fix pane resizing regression (revert to v1.3.0 logic) ([91db75d](https://github.com/AnganSamadder/opentmux/commit/91db75d15f1f1b5187f915292f0284da7d59f7e4))
* update CLI alias generation to use opentmux binary name ([fb4a058](https://github.com/AnganSamadder/opentmux/commit/fb4a058abc3e493abfe2cc69be6d4b9ed4dff3af))

## [1.2.7] - 2026-01-27

### Fixed
- Fixed issue where tmux window closes instantly when opencode exits with success code (0).
- Changed shell wrapper to always pause and show exit code after execution, ensuring users can see final output/errors before the window closes.
